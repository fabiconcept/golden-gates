        Hi! Goldwater went above and beyond with helping me access equity in my home!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Previously I thought I'd only be able to use the $$ towards home renovations or things of that nature, but Goldwater did a phenomenal job of educating me on the process and how I could use the funds. Goldwater's team was extremely patient and kind. Goldwater assisted me with customizing my loan term, so I did not have to start my loan over! If you are in the market to buy a new home or are seeking extra cash on hand, I highly recommend them. 10/10!! Thank you, Goldwater!!!!

            Goldwater is the lender you must choose. I was in desperate times because my previous lender out of nowhere decided to bump up my interest rate from 2.75 to 3.75 and luckily for me I met Calvin on facebook and he assured me all will be fine.
            <br/> <br/> He worked tirelessly to get me back the previous rate of 2.75 and I was able to close on time. I would definitely recommend Calvin and his team. He possesses this great work ethics and professionalism that is out of this world and on top of that he really cares about his clients. Look no further and let Goldwater take you to your new home!
